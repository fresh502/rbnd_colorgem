• How does your gem take advantage of Ruby’s metaprogramming capabilities?
	I can generate similar methods using class_eval and class variable.
	Class variable 'colors_n_code' is hash which contains colors as key and codes as value.
	I make instance methods using metaprogramming capabilities iterating through the hash.

• How long did you spend working on this project?
	I almost spent 4 hours working on this project.

• What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
	I had trouble escaping string interpolation inside class_eval method block.

• Where do you still have room to grow?
	I want to make complicated instance method using metaprogramming capabilities.
